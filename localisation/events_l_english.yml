 britain.1.t:0 "King George V Dies - Test"
 britain.1.d:0 "His Majesty, George V, King of United Kingdom and the British Dominions and Emperor of India has passed away. His quiet calm and devotion to his subjects saw the Empire through both the Great War and the Great Depression. His son will assume the mantle as King Edward VIII, but there are already concerns that he will be too independent of thought. Stanley Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain are preparing to ensure that he will accept direction from the Prime Minister and the Cabinet."

 britain.2.t:0 "King Edward Abdicates"
 britain.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Baldwin has made it quite clear that the dignity of the King-Emperor will be impinged if he were to marry not just a commoner, but also a divorcee and if that was not bad enough, an American. After much soul searching his majesty has chosen love over duty and has chosen to abdicate. His younger brother, Albert, will assume the mantle as King George VI. London bookmakers are already taking odds on whether this shy man will make it to his own coronation."
